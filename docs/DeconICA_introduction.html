<p>This is an introduction to the <a href="https://github.com/UrszulaCzerwinska/DeconICA"><code>deconICA</code></a> R package.</p>
<p><strong>DeconICA</strong> stands for <strong>Deconvolution of transcriptome through Immune Component Analysis</strong>.</p>
<p>The aim of the project is to adapt blind source separation techniques to extract immune-related signals from mixed biological samples. A great exaple of mixed biological sample is transcriptome measured in heterogenous tissue such as blood or tumor biopsy.</p>
<p>In this vignette we present short introduction to the blind source spearation techniques, the biological foundation of the problem and finally we walk you through examples on how to use <a href="https://github.com/UrszulaCzerwinska/DeconICA"><code>deconICA</code></a> R package.</p>
<p>If you are intrested only in practical examples of <a href="https://github.com/UrszulaCzerwinska/DeconICA"><code>deconICA</code></a>, skip directly to <a href="#Tut">Tutorial</a> section.</p>

<h1>Background</h1>
<div id="blind-source-separation" class="section level2">
<h2>Blind source separation</h2>
<p>Blind source separation (BSS) is the separation of a set of source signals from a set of mixed signals, without the aid of information (or with very little information) about the source signals or the mixing process. The separation is possible under a variety of conditions.</p>
<p>A known example of BSS is a <strong>cocktail party problem</strong>, there is a group of people talking at the same time. You have multiple microphones picking up mixed signals, but you want to isolate the speech of a single person. BSS can be used to separate the individual sources by using mixed signals <span class="citation">(Hyvärinen and Oja 2000)</span></p>
</div>
<div id="application-of-bss-to-biological-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Application of BSS to biological data</h2>
<p>Through decomposition of the transcriptome matrix into components (aka factors or sources) we hope to recover underlying biological functions and cell types.</p>
<p>In tumor biopsies is it expected to find a part of Tumor Microenvironment (TME). TME includes tumor cells, fibroblasts, and a diversity of immune cells. Most studies have focused on individual cell types in model tumor systems, and/or on individual molecules mediating a crosstalk between two cells. Unraveling the complexity, organization, and mutual interactions of TME cellular components represents a major challenge.</p>
<p>Several methods have been proposed to estimate the mixing proportions of sources in biological mixtures, such as: least squares regression <span class="citation">(Abbas et al. 2009)</span> and more recently, non-negative least squares regression [Qiao2012], quadratic programming [Gong2011] and supported vector regression <span class="citation">(Newman et al. 2015)</span>. Even though <span class="citation">(Vallania et al. 2017)</span> shows that the used algorithm do not impact substantially the results. According to <span class="citation">Vallania et al. (2017)</span>, what matters are the gene signatures used as an input of overmentioned methods.</p>
<p><strong>BSS methods do not use pre-defined cell-type signatures</strong>. The transcriptomic matrix is decomposed into a certain number of sources and then the sources are interpreted with available knowledge (gnee signatures, cell profiles).</p>
<p>The main argument of using BSS over supervised decomposition techniques is that the obtained result is <strong>unbiased</strong> by <em>a priori</em> biological hypothesis (however thre are alwyas statistical hypothesis about the nature of data) or knowledge. In addition BSS tachniques allow <strong>discovery</strong> of new biological signatures that can extend our available knowledge.</p>
<p>In the case of cell type separation from mix of tumor bulk, supervised techniques as CIBERSORT <span class="citation">(Newman et al. 2015)</span>, MCP counter <span class="citation">(Becht et al. 2016, <span class="citation">Becht and de Reynies (2016)</span>)</span>, TIMER <span class="citation">(Li et al. 2016)</span> etc. are based on optimised blood signatues. With an evidence brought by single cell data, these signatures are not always characterising immune cells infiltrating tumors <span class="citation">(Schelker et al. 2017)</span>. Some methods, like EPIC <span class="citation">(Racle et al. 2017)</span>, use single-cell based signatures. However, today, the single cell based signatures are limited to few cancer subtypes and often based on small number of patients, incoparable with the heterogeneity that is hidden in the bulk transcriptome cohort studies.</p>
<p>Thefore, obtaining informative cell-type signature of immune cells infiltrating tumor biopsy samples at high thoughput remains an open question that we attept to approach with <code>deconICA</code> pipeline.</p>
<p>Here is a short overview of BSS or related algorithms that one can potentially use as an input to <code>deconICA</code>. At its actual state <code>deconICA</code> facilitates starting pipeline with ICA.</p>
<div id="independent-components-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3>Independent Components Analysis</h3>
<p>Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a matrix factorization method for data dimension reduction <span class="citation">(Hyvärinen and Oja 2000)</span>. ICA defines a new coordinate system in the multi-dimensional space such that the distributions of the data point projections on the new axes become as mutually independent as possible. To achieve this, the standard approach is maximizing the non-gaussianity of the data point projection distributions <span class="citation">(Hyvärinen and Oja 2000)</span>. There is no contraint imposed on the non-negativity (in contrary to NMF) or orthogonality (in contrast to PCA). In our analysis, the negative projections are interpreted in terms of absolute values and only one side of a component is taken into account.</p>
<p>A mathematical way to formalize ICA is the set of equations:</p>
<p>the set of individual source signals <span class="math inline">\(s(t) = (s_{1}(t), ..., s_{n}(t))^T\)</span> is mixed using a matrix <span class="math inline">\(A = [a_{ij}] \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}\)</span> to produce a set of mixed signals, <span class="math inline">\(x(t) = (x_{1}(t), ..., x_{m}(t))^T\)</span>, as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[x(t) = A \times s(t)\]</span></p>
<p>The above equation is effectively ‘inverted’ as follows. Blind source separation separates the set of mixed signals <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span>, through the determination of an ‘unmixing’ matrix to <span class="math inline">\(B = [b_{ij}] \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}\)</span> ‘recover’ an approximation of the original signals, <span class="math inline">\(y(t) = (y_{1}(t), ..., y_{n}(t))^T\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y(t) = B \times x(t)\]</span></p>
<p>This algorithm uses higher-order moments for matrix approximation, considering all Gaussian signals as noise.</p>
<p>Most efficient application of ICA is fastICA <span class="citation">(Hyvärinen and Oja 2000)</span>. However, the speed comes with a price, the results of the algoritms are not exact. This is why we recommend use of ICA with stabilization (ICASSO <span class="citation">(Himberg and Hyvärinen 2003)</span>) for reproducible results. More about this is the vignette <a href="">Running matlab implementation of ICA</a>.</p>
<p>For applications in molecular biology, Independent Component Analysis (ICA) models gene expression data as an action of a set of statistically independent hidden factors.</p>
<p>Here is a small list of ICA application to biological data:</p>

<div id="nmf" class="section level3">
<h3>NMF</h3>
<p>Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is matrix factorization technique assuming that the mixing, source and mixed matrices are all non negative. It is usually written as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V = WH\]</span></p>
<p>Matrix multiplication can be implemented as computing the column vectors of <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> as linear combinations of the column vectors in <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> using coefficients supplied by columns of <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>. That is, each column of <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> can be computed as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{v}_{i}={W}{h}_{i}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(v_{i}\)</span> is the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th column vector of the product matrix <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(h_{i}\)</span> is the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th column vector of the matrix <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>.</p>
<p>There are many types of NMF, that differ in implementation, ways the error terms are defined and minimized.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Gaujoux and Seoighe (2012)</span> proposed a framework of semi-supervised NMF for solving cell and tissue mixtures in his R package <em>CellMix</em> <span class="citation">(Gaujoux and Seoighe 2013)</span>. His work deconvolution was of great inspiration for us and food for thoughts on the advantages and limits of BBS applied for cell type deconvolution.</p>
<p>Renaud Gaujoux is also an author of NMF R package <span class="citation">(Gaujoux and Seoighe 2010; Gaujoux and Seoighe 2015b; Gaujoux and Seoighe 2015a)</span>.</p>
<p>Work of Cantini et al. (<span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Cantini2018"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>) showed that ICA produces more reproducible results than NMF when applied to tumor transcriptomes.</p>
<p>However, we can always imagine the cases where NMF factorisation will be judged more adequate than ICA. Our pipeline is adaptable to interpretation of NMF factors without a need for major adjustments. We will be seen extend vignettes to show application of deconICA for interpreatation of NMF components.</p>

</ul>
</div>
<div id="convex-hull-methods" class="section level3">
<h3>Convex hull methods</h3>
<p>An emerging family of BSS methods are convex geometry (CG)-based methods. Here, the “sources” are found by searching the facets of the convex hull spanned by the mapped observations solving a classical convex optimization problem <span class="citation">(Yang and Michailidis 2015)</span>. The convex hull-based method does not require the independence assumption, nor the uncorrelation assumption which can be interesing in the setup of closely realted cell types. <span class="citation">Wang et al. (2016)</span> apply their method of convex analysis of mixtures (CAM) to tissue and cell mixtures claiming to provide new signatures. So far the published R-Java package does not allow to extract those signtures and it is not scalable to tumor transcriptomes. Another tool CellDistinguisher <span class="citation">(Newberg et al. 2018)</span> provides an <a href="https://github.com/GeneralElectric/CellDistinguisher">user-friendly R package</a>. However, authors do not provide any method for estimation of number of sources. Additionaly, quantitative weights are provided only for signature genes that can vary for different sources.</p>
<p>However, combining convex hull methods and <code>deconICA</code>can possibily lead to a meanigfull interpretation.</p>

</ul>
</div>
<div id="attractor-metagenes" class="section level3">
<h3>Attractor metagenes</h3>
<p>Another way of generating signatures, that can be run in semi-supervised or unsupervised mode is attractor metagenes method proposed by <span class="citation">Cheng, Ou Yang, and Anastassiou (2013)</span>. Authors describe their rationale as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can first define a consensus metagene from the average expression levels of all genes in the cluster, and rank all the individual genes in terms of their association (defined numerically by some form of correlation) with that metagene. We can then replace the member genes of the cluster with an equal number of the top-ranked genes. Some of the original genes may naturally remain as members of the cluster, but some may be replaced, as this process will ‘‘attract’’ some other genes that are more strongly correlated with the cluster. We can now define a new metagene defined by the average expression levels of the genes in the newly defined cluster, and re-rank all the individual genes in terms of their association with that new metagene; and so on. It is intuitively reasonable to expect that this iterative process will eventually converge to a cluster that contains precisely the genes that are most associated with the metagene of the same cluster, so that any other individual genes will be less strongly associated with the metagene. We can think of this particular cluster defined by the convergence of this iterative process as an ‘‘attractor,’’ i.e., a module of co-expressed genes to which many other gene sets with close but not identical membership will converge using the same computational methodology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The produced signatures’ weights are non-negative. In the original paper, the generation of tumor signatures leads to three reproductible signatures among different tumor types. Typically with the essential parmeter <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 5\)</span>, they discovered typically approximately 50 to 150 resulting attractors. Although, it is possible by tunig <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> obtain more or less signatures that would be possibly interpretable with <code>deconICA</code>.</p>
<p>Attractor metagenes R code is available on <a href="https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn1446295">Synapse portal</a>.</p>

<h3>Simulated data</h3>
<p>We assed first an ability to estimate bundance of cell types in a synthetic cell mixture. Here we use function <code>simulate_gene_expresssion()</code>inspired by <code>CellMix::rmix</code> function. However, compared to <code>rmix</code> function cell profiles distribution follow user defined distribution (uniform in <code>rmix</code>) set here by default to negative binomial which approaches the biological reality.</p>
<p>First we create the <em>mix1</em> that is a mix of 10 cell types mixed at random proportions. Obatined matrix has 10000 genes and 130 samples. Each celltype has 20 specific markers with 2-fold difference with respect to other genes.</p>

<p>One important feature of the ICA is that even if we do not know the exact number of components, when we overestimate the number of components, the signals are not altered.

<p><code>run_fastica</code> runs <code>fastica</code> from <code>fastica</code> package. In this trival example we create sources matrix <code>S</code>and mixing matrix <code>A</code> that we multuply to obtain <code>X</code>. Then we decompose <code>X</code> into <code>n.comp = 2</code>, with row centering (substracting mean from each row) <code>row.center = TRUE</code>. We also checked <code>overdecompose = FALSE</code>, <code>overdecompose = TRUE</code> would ignore number of components we defined with <code>ncomp</code>. It finds its use for more advanced analysis applied to transcriptome [see section ####]. Other parameters were selected as default.</p>
<p>Full description of the <code>run_fastica</code> parameters can be found in help <code>?run_fastica</code>.</p>
<p>The main differences between <code>run_fastica</code> and <code>fastica</code> are:</p>
<ul>
<li>if column names are provided with the matrix, duplicated names are removed and entries with higher variance are kept</li>
<li>it transforms data into log2 if data are in row counts</li>
<li>it runs a PCA before ICA to denoise the matrix</li>
<li>it allows running matlab version fastica with <em>icasso</em> stabilisation if matlab software is installed on your machine (more about this point in <em>vignette: running fastICA with icasso stabilisation</em>)</li>
<li>it returns in a <code>list</code>
<ul>
<li>input <code>data.frame</code> without duplicated entries and before log transformation: <code>log.counts</code></li>
<li><code>names</code> row names vector</li>
<li><code>samples</code>sample names vector</li>
<li><code>A</code>, <code>S</code>, <code>K</code> and <code>W</code> matrices (see <code>?run_fastica</code> for details) if run in <code>R=TRUE</code></li>
<li><code>A</code> and <code>S</code> matrices if run with <code>R=FALSE</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>overdecompose</code> parameter that selects number of composed needed to perform overdecomposition of the input matrix</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, <code>run_fastica()</code> performs ICA decomposition of the matrix and provides additional features usefull for the downstream analysis. The use of more advanced options will be demonstrated later on in this tutorial. It generates <em>components</em> or <em>sources</em> to which we will refer later on in the tutorial.</p>
<p>The step naturally following <code>run_fastica()</code> is <code>correlate_metagenes()</code>.</p>
<p>It is common that after an unsuperivsed decomposition, components should have attributed an interpretation or a meaning or a label. We call this process <em>interpret</em> components or <em>identify</em> sources. A domain knowledge is necessary to interpret components. In the case of transcriptomic data, components can be seen as weighted gene list.</p>
<p>An efficient way to in intrpret a component is to use correlation with some known profile or as we call it a <em>metagene</em>. If we dispose of a known weighted list of genes that characterize a biological phenomena or a cell type (a metagene), we can then correlate them with obtained components and verify is some of decomposed sources are close to the known cells/functions.</p>
<p>In our <code>deconICA</code> pipeline <code>correlate_metagenes()</code> can be used in order to correlate metagenes (gene lists: knowlege-based or data-driven) with the data-driven components.</p>

<p>In this case we use an example of an extract, of 60 samples, from transcriptomic data from breast cancer <span class="citation">(Bekhouche et al. 2011)</span>. At first, dataset is decomposed into an arbitrary number of 10 components. The <code>correlate_metagenes()</code> correlates the obtained <code>S</code> matrix with <em>Biton et al.</em> metagenes <span class="citation">(Biton et al. 2014)</span>. This set of 11 metagens is data-driven and was derived in the article <span class="citation">Biton et al. (2014)</span> from pan-cancer transcriptome as the reproducible signals, common to many cancer types. Some of the signatures as BCLAPATHWAYS or UROTHELIALDIF (urothelialdifferentiation) were shared amond many datasets, but within bladder cancer. They can bees as a sort of negative control.</p>
<p>However, any set weighted signatures with reasonable size can be used as metagenes. Later in this tutorial we use immune cell profiles optimized for cell type deconvolution from <span class="citation">(Newman et al. 2015)</span> <code>LM22.list</code>.</p>
<p>One can controle a minimal number of genes used for correlation with <code>n.genes.intersect</code> it is set to a magic number in statistics (30) by default.</p>

<p>The <code>correlate_metagenes()</code> returns <code>n</code>, <code>r</code>, <code>P</code> matrices which correspond to <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/Hmisc/versions/4.1-0/topics/rcorr"><code>Hmisc::rcorr</code></a> function output, number of genes on which correlation is based, correlation coefficient and p-value.</p>
<p>The <code>S.or</code> stands for <code>S</code> matrix that is <em>oriented</em>. Why the matrix should be oriented? If you used ICA to decompose gene expression then the positive and negative projections do not have meaning by itself. We developed a methodology orienting data in the direction of the <em>long tail</em> of the distribution. Which means highest absolute values of a component weight should be positive. However, if the distribution doesn’t have <em>tails</em> and is close to gaussian, an alternative, can be orienting components through maximal correlation. If we are confident with our metagenes, we can orient the <code>S</code> matrix so that the maximal correlation is always postive. We demontrate the use of <code>orient.max = FALSE</code> and obtained <code>S.or</code>in <a href="#cases">use cases section</a>. One can decide not to orient the <code>S</code> matrix through selecting <code>orient.long = FALSE</code> and <code>orient.max = FALSE</code>.</p>
<p>If we have a look at <code>r</code> matrix, we see, indeed, it contains correlations between components and provided metagenes.</p>

<p>These correlation matrix can be visualized in many ways. We propose a <em>radar plot</em> to evaluate quickly if there is a good match between metagenes and components. In this representation, we focus on positive correlations that have red color and placed away from the center of the circle (radar). We can see which component is attributed to the highest correlation for each metagene.</p>

<p>In order to <em>zoom in</em> into a correlation with a specific metagene, one can use a function <code>lolypop_plot_corr()</code></p>
<p>Here we can visualize for example SMOOTH_MUSCLE metagene that seems a bit unbigous.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r" id="cb60"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb60-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw">lolypop_plot_corr</span>(corr<span class="op">$</span>r,<span class="st">&quot;M3_SMOOTH_MUSCLE&quot;</span>)</a></code></pre>
<p><img src="DeconICA_introduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-82-1.png" /><!-- --></p>
<p>We can observe that the highest correlation is with IC4 0.44 but IC1: 0.28 is close as well. These two components may represent two diffrent types of functions or cells reated to muscles.</p>
<p>However, if we look at IMMUNE metagene, we can select one strongly correlated component: IC9, Pearson correlation coefficient equal to 0.73.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r" id="cb61"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb61-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw">lolypop_plot_corr</span>(corr<span class="op">$</span>r,<span class="st">&quot;M8_IMMUNE&quot;</span>)</a></code></pre>
<p><img src="DeconICA_introduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-85-1.png" /><!-- --></p>
<p>In case we have many profiles, an outomatic extraction of corresponding pairs metagene - component is handy.</p>
<p>A natural way is consider the component which Pearson correlation coefficient is highest as the one <em>corresponding</em> to a metagene. You can use <code>get_max_correlations()</code> to retreive this information from the correlation matrix.</p>

<p><code>get_max_correlations()</code> provides pearson correlation <code>r</code> column and the p-valye <code>p.val</code> to help decide if the maximal correlation can be used as labelling. One can decide on minimal threshold, or p-value to take a decision.</p>
<p>Another way to assign maetagene to a component can be trough reciprocal correlations. This method was used in our research articles [<span class="citation">Becht et al. (2016)</span>; RBH_paper]. In brief, given correlations between the set of metagenes <span class="math inline">\(M=\{M_{1},...,M_{m}\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> matrix <span class="math inline">\(S=\{IC_{1},...,IC_{N}\}\)</span>, if <span class="math inline">\(S_{i}=argmax_k(corr(M_{j},S_{k}))\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A_{j}=argmax_k (corr(S_{i},M_{k}))\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(S_{i}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M_{j}\)</span> are reciprocal. This approach is usefull with assumption that there should be one component corresponding to a metagene and one metagene corresponding to a component.</p>

<!-- Note the various macros within the `vignette` section of the metadata block above. These are required in order to instruct R how to build the vignette. Note that you should change the `title` field and the `\VignetteIndexEntry` to match the title of your vignette. -->
<!-- ## Styles -->
<!-- The `html_vignette` template includes a basic CSS theme. To override this theme you can specify your own CSS in the document metadata as follows: -->
<!--     output:  -->
<!--       rmarkdown::html_vignette: -->
<!--         css: mystyles.css -->
<!-- ## Figures -->
<!-- The figure sizes have been customised so that you can easily put two images side-by-side.  -->
<!-- ```{r, fig.show='hold'} -->
<!-- plot(1:10) -->
<!-- plot(10:1) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- You can enable figure captions by `fig_caption: yes` in YAML: -->
<!--     output: -->
<!--       rmarkdown::html_vignette: -->
<!--         fig_caption: yes -->
<!-- Then you can use the chunk option `fig.cap = "Your figure caption."` in **knitr**. -->
<!-- ## More Examples -->
<!-- You can write math expressions, e.g. $Y = X\beta + \epsilon$, footnotes^[A footnote here.], and tables, e.g. using `knitr::kable()`. -->
<!-- ```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'} -->
<!-- knitr::kable(head(mtcars, 10)) -->
