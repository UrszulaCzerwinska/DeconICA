abstract = {MOTIVATION Recent advances in high-throughput omics technologies have enabled biomedical researchers to collect large-scale genomic data. As a consequence, there has been growing interest in developing methods to integrate such data to obtain deeper insights regarding the underlying biological system. A key challenge for integrative studies is the heterogeneity present in the different omics data sources, which makes it difficult to discern the coordinated signal of interest from source-specific noise or extraneous effects. RESULTS We introduce a novel method of multi-modal data analysis that is designed for heterogeneous data based on non-negative matrix factorization. We provide an algorithm for jointly decomposing the data matrices involved that also includes a sparsity option for high-dimensional settings. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on synthetic data and on real DNA methylation, gene expression and miRNA expression data from ovarian cancer samples obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The results show the presence of common modules across patient samples linked to cancer-related pathways, as well as previously established ovarian cancer subtypes.

abstract = {BACKGROUND While in principle a seemingly infinite variety of combinations of mutations could result in tumor development, in practice it appears that most human cancers fall into a relatively small number of "sub-types," each characterized a roughly equivalent sequence of mutations by which it progresses in different patients. There is currently great interest in identifying the common sub-types and applying them to the development of diagnostics or therapeutics. Phylogenetic methods have shown great promise for inferring common patterns of tumor progression, but suffer from limits of the technologies available for assaying differences between and within tumors. One approach to tumor phylogenetics uses differences between single cells within tumors, gaining valuable information about intra-tumor heterogeneity but allowing only a few markers per cell. An alternative approach uses tissue-wide measures of whole tumors to provide a detailed picture of averaged tumor state but at the cost of losing information about intra-tumor heterogeneity. RESULTS The present work applies "unmixing" methods, which separate complex data sets into combinations of simpler components, to attempt to gain advantages of both tissue-wide and single-cell approaches to cancer phylogenetics. We develop an unmixing method to infer recurring cell states from microarray measurements of tumor populations and use the inferred mixtures of states in individual tumors to identify possible evolutionary relationships among tumor cells. Validation on simulated data shows the method can accurately separate small numbers of cell states and infer phylogenetic relationships among them. Application to a lung cancer dataset shows that the method can identify cell states corresponding to common lung tumor types and suggest possible evolutionary relationships among them that show good correspondence with our current understanding of lung tumor development. CONCLUSIONS Unmixing methods provide a way to make use of both intra-tumor heterogeneity and large probe sets for tumor phylogeny inference, establishing a new avenue towards the construction of detailed, accurate portraits of common tumor sub-types and the mechanisms by which they develop. These reconstructions are likely to have future value in discovering and diagnosing novel cancer sub-types and in identifying targets for therapeutic development.},

abstract = {Mining gene expression profiles has proven valuable for identifying signatures serving as surrogates of cancer phenotypes. However, the similarities of such signatures across different cancer types have not been strong enough to conclude that they represent a universal biological mechanism shared among multiple cancer types. Here we present a computational method for generating signatures using an iterative process that converges to one of several precise attractors defining signatures representing biomolecular events, such as cell transdifferentiation or the presence of an amplicon. By analyzing rich gene expression datasets from different cancer types, we identified several such biomolecular events, some of which are universally present in all tested cancer types in nearly identical form. Although the method is unsupervised, we show that it often leads to attractors with strong phenotypic associations. We present several such multi-cancer attractors, focusing on three that are prominent and sharply defined in all cases: a mesenchymal transition attractor strongly associated with tumor stage, a mitotic chromosomal instability attractor strongly associated with tumor grade, and a lymphocyte-specific attractor.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED Gene expression data are typically generated from heterogeneous biological samples that are composed of multiple cell or tissue types, in varying proportions, each contributing to global gene expression. This heterogeneity is a major confounder in standard analysis such as differential expression analysis, where differences in the relative proportions of the constituent cells may prevent or bias the detection of cell-specific differences. Computational deconvolution of global gene expression is an appealing alternative to costly physical sample separation techniques and enables a more detailed analysis of the underlying biological processes at the cell-type level. To facilitate and popularize the application of such methods, we developed CellMix, an R package that incorporates most state-of-the-art deconvolution methods, into an intuitive and extendible framework, providing a single entry point to explore, assess and disentangle gene expression data from heterogeneous samples. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION The CellMix package builds on R/BioConductor and is available from http://web.cbio.uct.ac.za/âˆ¼renaud/CRAN/web/CellMix.

Novel computational methods are needed to estimate tumor-infiltrating immune cells and understand tumorâ€“immune interactions in cancers. We analyze tumor-infiltrating immune cells in over 10,000 RNA-seq samples across 23 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our computationally inferred immune infiltrates associate much more strongly with patient clinical features, viral infection status, and cancer genetic alterations than other computational approaches. Analysis of cancer/testis antigen expression and CD8 T-cell abundance suggests that MAGEA3 is a potential immune target in melanoma, but not in non-small cell lung cancer, and implicates SPAG5 as an alternative cancer vaccine target in multiple cancers. We find that melanomas expressing high levels of CTLA4 separate into two distinct groups with respect to CD8 T-cell infiltration, which might influence clinical responses to anti-CTLA4 agents. We observe similar dichotomy of TIM3 expression with respect to CD8 T cells in kidney cancer and validate it experimentally.

abstract = {Bulk tissue samples examined by gene expression studies are usually heterogeneous. The data gained from these samples display the confounding patterns of mixtures consisting of multiple cell types or similar cell types in various functional states, which hinders the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying complex biological phenomena. A realistic approach to compensate for the limitations of experimentally separating homogenous cell populations from mixed tissues is to computationally identify cell-type specific patterns from bulk, heterogeneous measurements. We designed the CellDistinguisher algorithm to analyze the gene expression data of mixed samples, identifying genes that best distinguish biological processes and cell types. Coupled with a deconvolution algorithm that takes cell type specific gene lists as input, we show that CellDistinguisher performs as well as partial deconvolution algorithms in predicting cell type composition without the need for prior knowledge of cell type signatures. This approach is also better in predicting cell type signatures than the one-step traditional complete deconvolution methods. To illustrate its wide applicability, the algorithm was tested on multiple publicly available data sets. In each case, CellDistinguisher identified genes reflecting biological processes typical for the tissues and development stages of interest and estimated the sample compositions accurately.},

These changes include general leukopenia, activation of B and T cells, and maturation of granulocytes. The manifestation of SLE in peripheral blood is central to the disease but is incompletely understood. A technique for rigorously characterizing changes in mixed populations of cells, microarray expression deconvolution, has been applied to several areas of biology but not to SLE or to blood. Here we demonstrate that microarray expression deconvolution accurately quantifies the constituents of real blood samples and mixtures of immune-derived cell lines. We characterize a broad spectrum of peripheral leukocyte cell types and states in SLE to uncover novel patterns including: specific activation of NK and T helper lymphocytes, relationships of these patterns to each other, and correlations to clinical variables and measures. The expansion and activation of monocytes, NK cells, and T helper cells in SLE at least partly underlie this disease's prominent interferon signature. These and other patterns of leukocyte dynamics uncovered here correlate with disease severity and treatment, suggest potential new treatments, and extend our understanding of lupus pathology as a complex autoimmune disease involving many arms of the immune system.},

abstract = {Background: Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a method that models gene expression data as an action of a set of statistically independent hidden factors. The output of ICA depends on a fundamental parameter: the number of components (factors) to compute. The optimal choice of this parameter, related to determining the effective data dimension, remains an open question in the application of blind source separation techniques to transcriptomic data. Results: Here we address the question of optimizing the number of statistically independent components in the analysis of transcriptomic data for reproducibility of the components in multiple runs of ICA (within the same or within varying effective dimensions) and in multiple independent datasets. To this end, we introduce ranking of independent components based on their stability in multiple ICA computation runs and define a distinguished number of components (Most Stable Transcriptome Dimension, MSTD) corresponding to the point of the qualitative change of the stability profile. Based on a large body of data, we demonstrate that a sufficient number of dimensions is required for biological interpretability of the ICA decomposition and that the most stable components with ranks below MSTD have more chances to be reproduced in independent studies compared to the less stable ones. At the same time, we show that a transcriptomics dataset can be reduced to a relatively high number of dimensions without losing the interpretability of ICA, even though higher dimensions give rise to components driven by small gene sets. Conclusions: We suggest a protocol of ICA application to transcriptomics data with a possibility of prioritizing components with respect to their reproducibility that strengthens the biological interpretation. Computing too few components (much less than MSTD) is not optimal for interpretability of the results. The components ranked within MSTD range have more chances to be reproduced in independent studies.},

abstract = {Exploring linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns among the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites can improve the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of genomic association studies, whereby representative (tag) SNPs are identified to sufficiently represent the genomic diversity in populations. There has been considerable amount of effort in developing efficient algorithms to select tag SNPs from the growing large-scale data sets. Methods using the classical pairwise-LD and multi-locus LD measures have been proposed that aim to reduce the computational complexity and to increase the accuracy, respectively. The present work solves the tag SNP selection problem by efficiently balancing the computational complexity and accuracy, and improves the coverage in genomic diversity in a cost-effective manner. The employed algorithm makes use of mutual information to explore the multi-locus association between SNPs and can handle different data types and conditions. Experiments with benchmark HapMap data sets show comparable or better performance against the state-of-the-art algorithms. In particular, as a novel application, the genome-wide SNP tagging is performed in the 1000 Genomes Project data sets, and produced a well-annotated database of tagging variants that capture the common genotype diversity in 2,504 samples from 26 human populations. Compared to conventional methods, the algorithm requires as input only the genotype (or haplotype) sequences, can scale up to genome-wide analyses, and produces accurate solutions with more information-rich output, providing an improved platform for researchers towards the subsequent association studies.},

abstract = {The quantity of mRNA transcripts in a cell is determined by a complex interplay of cooperative and counteracting biological processes. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is one of a few number of unsupervised algorithms that have been applied to microarray gene expression data in an attempt to understand phenotype differences in terms of changes in the activation/inhibition patterns of biological pathways. While the ICA model has been shown to outperform other linear representations of the data such as Principal Components Analysis (PCA), a validation using explicit pathway and regulatory element information has not yet been performed. We apply a range of popular ICA algorithms to six of the largest microarray cancer datasets and use pathway-knowledge and regulatory-element databases for validation. We show that ICA outperforms PCA and clustering-based methods in that ICA components map closer to known cancer-related pathways, regulatory modules, and cancer phenotypes. Furthermore, we identify cancer signalling and oncogenic pathways and regulatory modules that play a prominent role in breast cancer and relate the differential activation patterns of these to breast cancer phenotypes. Importantly, we find novel associations linking immune response and epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathways with estrogen receptor status and histological grade, respectively. In addition, we find associations linking the activity levels of biological pathways and transcription factors (NF1 and NFAT) with clinical outcome in breast cancer. ICA provides a framework for a more biologically relevant interpretation of genomewide transcriptomic data. Adopting ICA as the analysis tool of choice will help understand the phenotype-pathway relationship and thus help elucidate the molecular taxonomy of heterogeneous cancers and of other complex genetic diseases.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is an aggressive form of BC poorly defined at the molecular level. We compared the molecular portraits of 63 IBC and 134 non-IBC (nIBC) clinical samples. METHODOLOGY/FINDINGS: Genomic imbalances of 49 IBCs and 124 nIBCs were determined using high-resolution array-comparative genomic hybridization, and mRNA expression profiles of 197 samples using whole-genome microarrays. Genomic profiles of IBCs were as heterogeneous as those of nIBCs, and globally relatively close. However, IBCs showed more frequent "complex" patterns and a higher percentage of genes with CNAs per sample. The number of altered regions was similar in both types, although some regions were altered more frequently and/or with higher amplitude in IBCs. Many genes were similarly altered in both types; however, more genes displayed recurrent amplifications in IBCs. The percentage of genes whose mRNA expression correlated with CNAs was similar in both types for the gained genes, but âˆ¼7-fold lower in IBCs for the lost genes. Integrated analysis identified 24 potential candidate IBC-specific genes. Their combined expression accurately distinguished IBCs and nIBCS in an independent validation set, and retained an independent prognostic value in a series of 1,781 nIBCs, reinforcing the hypothesis for a link with IBC aggressiveness. Consistent with the hyperproliferative and invasive phenotype of IBC these genes are notably involved in protein translation, cell cycle, RNA processing and transcription, metabolism, and cell migration. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a higher genomic instability of IBC. We established the first repertory of DNA copy number alterations in this tumor, and provided a list of genes that may contribute to its aggressiveness and represent novel therapeutic targets.},

abstract = {A major problem in application of independent component analysis (ICA) is that the reliability of the estimated independent components is not known. Firstly, the finite sample size induces statistical errors in the estimation. Secondly, as real data never exactly follows the ICA model, the contrast function used in the estimation may have many local minima which are all equally good, or the practical algorithm may not always perform properly, for example getting stuck in local minima with strongly suboptimal values of the contrast function. We present an explorative visualization method for investigating the relations between estimates from FastICA. The algorithmic and statistical reliability is investigated by running the algorithm many times with different initial values or with differently bootstrapped data sets, respectively. Resulting estimates are compared by visualizing their clustering according to a suitable similarity measure. Reliable estimates correspond to tight clusters, and unreliable ones to points which do not belong to any such cluster. We have developed a software package called Icasso to implement these operations. We also present results of this method when applying Icasso on biomedical data.},

abstract = {Extracting relevant information from large-scale data offers unprecedented opportunities in cancerology. We applied independent component analysis (ICA) to bladder cancer transcriptome data sets and interpreted the components using gene enrichment analysis and tumor-associated molecular, clinicopathological, and processing information. We identified components associated with biological processesoftumor cells or the tumor microenvironment, andother components revealed technical biases. Applying ICA to nine cancer types identified cancer-shared and bladder-cancer-specific components. We characterized the luminal and basal-like subtypes of muscle-invasive bladder cancers according to the components identified. The study of the urothelial differentiation component, specific to the luminal subtypes, showed that a molecular urothelial differentiation program was maintained even in those luminal tumors that had lost morphological differentiation. Study of the genomic alterations associated with this component coupled with functional studies revealed a protumorigenic role for PPARG in luminal tumors. Our results support the inclusion of ICA in the exploitation of multiscale data sets.},

@article{Hyvarinen2000,
abstract = {A fundamental problem in neural network research, as well as in many other disciplines, is finding a suitable representation of multivariate data, i.e. random vectors. For reasons of computational and conceptual simplicity, the representation is often sought as a linear transformation of the original data. In other words, each component of the representation is a linear combination of the original variables. Well-known linear transformation methods include principal component analysis, factor analysis, and projection pursuit. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a recently developed method in which the goal is to find a linear representation of nongaussian data so that the components are statistically independent, or as independent as possible. Such a representation seems to capture the essential structure of the data in many applications, including feature extraction and signal separation. In this paper, we present the basic theory and applications of ICA, and our recent work on the subject.},

abstract = {In silico quantification of cell proportions from mixed-cell transcriptomics data (deconvolution) requires a reference expression matrix, called basis matrix. We hypothesized that matrices created using only healthy samples from a single microarray platform would introduce biological and technical biases in deconvolution. We show presence of such biases in two existing matrices, IRIS and LM22, irrespective of the deconvolution method used. Here, we present immunoStates, a basis matrix built using 6160 samples with different disease states across 42 microarray platforms. We found that immunoStates significantly reduced biological and technical biases. We further show that cellular proportion estimates using immunoStates are consistently more correlated with measured proportions than IRIS and LM22, across all methods. Importantly, we found that different methods have virtually no effect once the basis matrix is chosen. Our results demonstrate the need and importance of incorporating biological and technical heterogeneity in a basis matrix for achieving consistently high accuracy.},

abstract = {We describe here the use of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), an algorithm based on decomposition by parts that can reduce the dimension of expression data from thousands of genes to a handful of metagenes. Coupled with a model selection mechanism, adapted to work for any stochastic clustering algorithm, NMF is an efficient method for identification of distinct molecular patterns and provides a powerful method for class discovery. We demonstrate the ability of NMF to recover meaningful biological information from cancer-related microarray data. NMF appears to have advantages over other methods such as hierarchical clustering or self-organizing maps. We found it less sensitive to a priori selection of genes or initial conditions and able to detect alternative or context-dependent patterns of gene expression in complex biological systems. This ability, similar to semantic polysemy in text, provides a general method for robust molecular pattern discovery.},

@article{Gong2011,
abstract = {Large-scale molecular profiling technologies have assisted the identification of disease biomarkers and facilitated the basic understanding of cellular processes. However, samples collected from human subjects in clinical trials possess a level of complexity, arising from multiple cell types, that can obfuscate the analysis of data derived from them. Failure to identify, quantify, and incorporate sources of heterogeneity into an analysis can have widespread and detrimental effects on subsequent statistical studies. We describe an approach that builds upon a linear latent variable model, in which expression levels from mixed cell populations are modeled as the weighted average of expression from different cell types. We solve these equations using quadratic programming, which efficiently identifies the globally optimal solution while preserving non-negativity of the fraction of the cells. We applied our method to various existing platforms to estimate proportions of different pure cell or tissue types and gene expression profilings of distinct phenotypes, with a focus on complex samples collected in clinical trials. We tested our methods on several well controlled benchmark data sets with known mixing fractions of pure cell or tissue types and mRNA expression profiling data from samples collected in a clinical trial. Accurate agreement between predicted and actual mixing fractions was observed. In addition, our method was able to predict mixing fractions for more than ten species of circulating cells and to provide accurate estimates for relatively rare cell types ({\textless}10{\%} total population). Furthermore, accurate changes in leukocyte trafficking associated with Fingolomid (FTY720) treatment were identified that were consistent with previous results generated by both cell counts and flow cytometry. These data suggest that our method can solve one of the open questions regarding the analysis of complex transcriptional data: namely, how to identify the optimal mixing fractions in a given experiment.},

@article{Qiao2012,
abstract = {The cellular composition of heterogeneous samples can be predicted using an expression deconvolution algorithm to decompose their gene expression profiles based on pre-defined, reference gene expression profiles of the constituent populations in these samples. However, the expression profiles of the actual constituent populations are often perturbed from those of the reference profiles due to gene expression changes in cells associated with microenvironmental or developmental effects. Existing deconvolution algorithms do not account for these changes and give incorrect results when benchmarked against those measured by well-established flow cytometry, even after batch correction was applied. We introduce PERT, a new probabilistic expression deconvolution method that detects and accounts for a shared, multiplicative perturbation in the reference profiles when performing expression deconvolution. We applied PERT and three other state-of-the-art expression deconvolution methods to predict cell frequencies within heterogeneous human blood samples that were collected under several conditions (uncultured mono-nucleated and lineage-depleted cells, and culture-derived lineage-depleted cells). Only PERT's predicted proportions of the constituent populations matched those assigned by flow cytometry. Genes associated with cell cycle processes were highly enriched among those with the largest predicted expression changes between the cultured and uncultured conditions. We anticipate that PERT will be widely applicable to expression deconvolution strategies that use profiles from reference populations that vary from the corresponding constituent populations in cellular state but not cellular phenotypic identity.},

Feasibility is demonstrated by validation with flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry and single-cell RNA-Seq analyses of human melanoma and colorectal tumor specimens.
